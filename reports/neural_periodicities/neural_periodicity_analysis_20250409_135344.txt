SUMMARY STATISTICS:
- Data points analyzed: 108
- Detected Teff periodicity: 100.00 ± 0.00
- Detected logg periodicity: 0.0500 ± 0.0000
- Number of pattern clusters: 4
- Suggested additional points: 200


DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS:
========================

1. CLUSTER-BASED SAMPLING STRATEGY:
   The data reveals 4 distinct pattern clusters. We recommend:
   - Cluster 0: Contains 7 points
   - Cluster 1: Contains 52 points
   - Cluster 2: Contains 14 points
   - Cluster 3: Contains 13 points

2. PERIODICITY-BASED SAMPLING STRATEGY:
   The detected periodicities suggest a grid-based sampling approach:
   - Sample at Teff intervals of 100.0
   - Sample at logg intervals of 0.0500

3. ANOMALY INVESTIGATION STRATEGY:
   6 potential anomalies detected with high reconstruction error.

4. NEXT STEPS:
   Most promising regions to explore:
   - Region 1: Teff = 8000.0, logg range: 4.51-4.60
   - Region 2: Teff = 8025.8, logg range: 3.90-4.60
   - Region 3: Teff = 8051.6, logg range: 3.90-4.60
   - Region 4: Teff = 8077.4, logg range: 3.90-4.60
   - Region 5: Teff = 8103.2, logg range: 3.90-4.60

   We recommend collecting at least 40 additional data points based on the neural analysis to further refine the model.
