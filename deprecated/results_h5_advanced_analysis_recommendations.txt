DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA COLLECTION:
============================================================

1. PATTERN ASSESSMENT: The data shows 5 distinct cluster pattern(s).
   - Recommended strategy: Focus sampling in these clustered regions.

2. DETECTED PERIODICITIES:
   - Temperature (Teff): 222.95
   - Surface Gravity (logg): 0.3014
   - For optimal sampling, collect points at these intervals

3. PRIORITY SAMPLING REGIONS (Top 8 Temperature Bands):
   • Region 1: Teff ≈ 7650.0, logg range: 4.98-5.05 (2 points recommended)
   • Region 2: Teff ≈ 7700.0, logg range: 4.98-5.05 (2 points recommended)
   • Region 3: Teff ≈ 7800.0, logg range: 4.98-5.05 (2 points recommended)
   • Region 4: Teff ≈ 7850.0, logg range: 4.98-5.05 (2 points recommended)
   • Region 5: Teff ≈ 7900.0, logg range: 3.45-5.05 (25 points recommended)
   • Region 6: Teff ≈ 7950.0, logg range: 3.45-5.05 (25 points recommended)
   • Region 7: Teff ≈ 8000.0, logg range: 4.90-5.05 (3 points recommended)
   • Region 8: Teff ≈ 8050.0, logg range: 4.98-5.05 (2 points recommended)

   Total suggested additional points: 200

4. REGIONS OF UNCERTAINTY (High Error Areas):
   • Area 1: Teff = 7665.6, logg = 4.9757
   • Area 2: Teff = 9077.9, logg = 4.9757
   • Area 3: Teff = 8061.0, logg = 5.0521
   • Area 4: Teff = 8569.5, logg = 4.8229
   • Area 5: Teff = 8908.4, logg = 3.6007

   These areas show high model uncertainty and would benefit from additional sampling.

5. SAMPLING STRATEGY SUMMARY:
   • Focus on collecting at least 20 additional data points
   • Prioritize the clustered regions identified above
   • Maintain approximate periodicity spacing within each cluster
